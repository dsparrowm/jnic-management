# Epic 3 — Reporting Hierarchy

Read `AGENTS.md` before starting.

**Phases:** 4, 5, 6  
**User stories:** US-3.1–US-3.6

## Scope

Weekly reports flow Branch → Zone → State → HQ with drill-down views, non-blocking
feedback, notifications, and monthly aggregation with Lead Pastor national approval.

**Depends on:** Phase 2 (org hierarchy), Phase 4 (weekly report entity), Epic 4 fields.

## User Story Acceptance

### US-3.1 — Branch submit

- [x] Unified form with attendance + finance (see `04-attendance-finance.md`)
- [x] Tied to service date and week
- [x] Status = SUBMITTED (pending zone review) on create
- [x] Editable only before `status >= ZONE_REVIEWED`

### US-3.2 — Zonal review

- [x] View all branch reports in zone with drill-down
- [x] Leave feedback on branch report
- [x] Zone aggregate auto-computed regardless of feedback

### US-3.3 — State view

- [x] All zones in state with drill-down to branch
- [x] State Pastor can leave feedback on zone or branch reports

### US-3.4 — National dashboard

- [x] Totals by state, zone, branch with drill-down
- [x] Lead Pastor and Admin can leave feedback at any level

### US-3.5 — Feedback

- [x] Feedback tied to report; visible as thread
- [x] Notification on new feedback (in-app + email)
- [x] Feedback does not block status progression

### US-3.6 — Monthly summary

- [ ] Auto-aggregate from weekly reports in calendar month
- [ ] Scoped to viewer's level (branch/zone/state/HQ)
- [ ] Totals + weekly breakdown side by side
- [ ] HQ/national summary requires Lead Pastor approval

## Report Status Flow

```
SUBMITTED → ZONE_REVIEWED → STATE_REVIEWED → HQ_REVIEWED
```

Progression is automatic (not gated on feedback). Zone/State/Lead Pastor viewing the
report advances or marks the corresponding status.
